## New Video

I've got a new video up. This one is comparing Parsec and Moonlight on GCP. I tried to make the video geared towards people trying to decide between Parsec and Moonlight on GCP. As a result, the video is rather qualitative, and features shots showcasing the ups and downs of Moonlight and Parsec. I found that Moonlight was outperforming Parsec in every capacity of the stream. The video was more clear, it was smoother, and perhaps the only place they seemed on equal footing was the latency: both were low.

<br>

My hope with this video is that it will help shift people away from using Parsec and more towards using Moonlight. And how can they shift from Parsec to Moonlight? Using the written and video tutorial! :D

## Updating Written Tutorial

The video tutorial took a long time to put together, so I didn't have as much time as I would have liked for updating the written tutorial. It ended up being a bit more complicated than I had hoped, as I had to explain that the user needed to use Remote Desktop to enter the computer, then log into Parsec, and then could continue on with the tutorial. Because of this, I have the steps written for the update, but I still need to get some screenshots of some differing steps when using the custom image and do some testing to double-check all the steps.

## Written Comparison

Now that the video comparing Parsec and Moonlight is up, I'm going to work on another Medium article comparing the two software. It will likely be very similar content to that of the video, except in written form. The benefit to this, as Professor Yarger explained, is that it can be more easily referenced in the future.

## Interesting Startup

The other day, I came across [this cloud gaming startup](https://www.clastr.net/) that I think has an interesting idea. Their idea is that PC owners can sign up to allow users to play their games on their PC when they're away. And in that time, the owner is paid. It's a cool idea, though I think perhaps a little too ambitious for the team on the website. Nevertheless, I could see this being an intermediate form of cloud gaming between today and some more-centralized future.

## Hours

* Moonlight vs. Parsec on GCP video - 9 hours
* Updating written tutorial - 2 hours
* Researching cloud gaming, particularly reading Dr. Chun-Ying Huang's [GamingAnywhere](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2483977.2483981) article, and soliciting interviews - 1 hour
