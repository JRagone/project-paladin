## Moonlight Guide Released

I'm really excited about this! After a lot of testing, taking screenshots, and polishing, the [Moonlight guide](https://johnragone.medium.com/500-hours-of-free-4k-60-fps-cloud-gaming-c796fa10f0a3) is out! I posted the article to Medium and created a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cloudygamer/comments/jjn5sf/a_guide_to_gcp_and_moonlight/) on the relevant subreddit, [r/cloudygamer](https://www.reddit.com/r/cloudygamer/). I also sent a message to Cameron Gutman, the lead dev for Moonlight, letting him know about the guide. I can't imagine that this is anything that will generate buzz, but my hope is that in the next week or so, I'll see comments about people attempting the tutorial. With those comments, I hope to improve the tutorial by maybe clarifying or adding certain steps.

More exciting to me than the publishing of this tutorial is the idea that it could help somebody else who had given up on running Moonlight on GCP. And perhaps that person, now able to run Moonlight on GCP, will then be able to make a greater contribution to Moonlight or cloud gaming.

## Next Step

With the guide released, there's a number of places I can look into for next steps. Firstly, I'm working on a video tutorial of the guide. I plan to release that next week. There's also an array of testing possibilities opened by running Moonlight on GCP. Last week, I mentioned benchmarking Moonlight vs Parsec on GCP and comparing them between different games and bitrates. I could also work on a script to set up a GCP machine for Moonlight gaming. Or I could try testing multiple GPUs on a single machine to see whether my guide is still applicable. For now, I'm going to keep focus on the video tutorial, but I think the step after that will likely be benchmarking.

## Interview with Sam Lantinga

Unfortunately, the header here is a bit of a misnomer. Last week, Sam said I could send him questions, and he would check with Valve to see which he could answer. Below is a screenshot of the questions I sent.

I sent a number of questions, because I wanted to make sure that if there were some he couldn't answer, I'd still have a few he could. Sadly, he replied "I reviewed the questions with the legal department, and weâ€™d rather not comment at this point." This was a bummer, and for some reason it felt a little worse when he left "Sent from my iPhone" in the reply. At the very least, I would have hoped that my final question wouldn't have tripped any legal issues. And even then, I tried to keep most of my questions generic and not Steam-specific.

This puts me at a momentary dead end on interviews, so I'll have to also spend time next week finding new contacts and sending some more emails.
