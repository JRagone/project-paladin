## Primary Audience

Cloud gaming developers stand to benefit the most from the planned cloud gaming research. These people tend to work at either large companies with subsidiaries implementing cloud gaming like at Google or Microsoft or smaller startups like Shadow or the team at Parsec.

Cloud gaming developers tend to work on the architecture of a cloud gaming platform and are challenged with issues of lowering latency and bandwidth. It's important that the research in some way lightens the load of cloud gaming on either the client or the remote servers.

<br>

Those working at larger companies likely have an array of resources and few monetary barriers. On the other hand, at the smaller companies, funding may not be so easy and cost-effective solutions are probably highly prized.
