## Guide Draft

Last week I set out with the intention of publishing the Moonlight on GCP guide. That might have been a bit of a reach to do in one week, as the scope of the guide is rather large. While the article is not yet published, I've completed a draft of it, and it currently sits at about 2500 words. All the steps to run Moonlight on GCP are written out, but there's a number of places I want to add screenshots highlighting what to click and what certain screens should look like. I'll post some screenshots below from the draft.

I was looking around online and I'm pretty hopeful there's going to be an audience for this guide. About every week there's a post like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cloudygamer/comments/jbl3gy/would_there_be_an_interest_for_a_guide_on_setting/) on the cloud gaming subreddit, and people always seem interested in more guides. Next week I'll be polishing and publishing this draft, as well as starting on a video tutorial of the guide.

## Interview with Benjy Boxer of Parsec

I'll fill the rest of this post with some discussion on my interview this week with Benjy Boxer, the CEO at Parsec. This interview was over email, and he had some interesting viewpoints that were pretty divergent from my interview with Cameron Gutman, the lead developer at Moonlight. I posted below a screenshot of what I thought was his most notable answer.

This was a new perspective from what I read in the research papers and understood talking to Cameron Gutman. But considering it now, it feels like a rather narrow viewpoint. I'll paraphrase what I think Benjy is saying here: PC, Xbox, and PlayStation offer great, local experiences, and the cloud is mean to offer unique, cloud experiences. I can't help but feel though that this isn't necessarily the case. And the analogy that comes to mind is Netflix. Considering Netflix as cloud gaming, one would certainly have been right to say years ago that Netflix did not offer the same quality service as an in-home blueray console or a night at the movie theater. But what Netflix did offer, critically, was accessability. It wasn't that people watched Netflix because they thought it would look better than blueray. People watched Netflix because it was available when blueray wasn't. Similarly, cloud gaming isn't setting out to beat someone's local ray tracing NVIDIA 3090 setup. Rather, cloud gaming is setting out to let the person on their Mac, Linux, Steam Link, Rasperry Pi, IPhone, Android, Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Google Chrome OS, Playstation Vita, and more play games that would otherwise be entirely unplayable on those devices.

<br>

Nevertheless, I should note that Parsec isn't a cloud gaming company primarily. Parsec seeks to leverage cloud gaming technology to enable online co-op in games that would otherwise only offer co-op locally. In short, they look to bring local multiplayer online, and in that light, it's easy to see where Benjy's answer is coming from. The Parsec team is focused on producing a unique experience, and producing the same experience through a different back end doesn't seem to fit the bill.
