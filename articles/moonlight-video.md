## Video Tutorial

This week was primarily focused on creating and publishing the video tutorial for Moonlight. The video follows each step of the guide and serves as a reference for people to follow along or cross-check in case they face errors when following the written tutorial. It's pretty long &mdash; a little over a half hour &mdash; but it's fairly comprehensive. There is one person on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cloudygamer/comments/jjn5sf/a_guide_to_gcp_and_moonlight/) who had issues when following the written tutorial, so I'm going to follow up and see if this tutorial helps. I've also updated the [Medium article](https://johnragone.medium.com/500-hours-of-free-4k-60-fps-cloud-gaming-c796fa10f0a3) with a section for this video tutorial.

## Custom Images

Last week, Professor Yarger suggested looking into a way to write a script or make some sort of sharable snapshot of the Moonlight PC. I managed to make a [custom image](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/windows/creating-windows-os-image#console) on GCP, and it works great! I can start an instance from the image, and most of the steps from the guide are compressed into just selecting the image. What I haven't figured out yet is how to share that custom image publicly. There are steps to make a custom image public, which I've followed, but I don't know about how someone accesses that custom image. That's something I'm going to test more and plan to figure out next week. Also next week, I plan to work on benchmarking between Parsec and Moonlight for a second comparison video.

## Upcoming Interview

Since my interview with Sam Lantinga last week didn't work out, I set out to find some new contacts this week. I sent some emails to people whose research I've read, and so far, I have one promising reply from [Dr. Wei Cai](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wei_Cai5). I think that will be either a zoom or email interview next week.
