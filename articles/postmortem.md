## Design Expo

Not much happened during the design expo, unfortunately, and most of the time was spent idling. However, Eash, an IA in EECS 494, did show up, so I was able to run through my presentation once. He was very literate in modern encodings and uses Parsec to stream games from his own PC. He mentioned that there was a recent [newsletter by Fraunhofer](https://newsletter.fraunhofer.de/-viewonline2/17386/465/11/14SHcBTt/V44RELLZBp/1) about a new encoding, H.266. This is the successor to H.265, which is what Moonlight and Parsec use. According to the newsletter, H.266 reduces the bit rate requirements for streaming by 50%! If this works as well in cloud gaming implementations, the future of cloud gaming could be a lot closer than I originally imagined!

## Semester

### Successes

I was very lucky in terms of what went well this semester. My project originally began with the ambition to let cloud gaming enthusiasts create their own custom machine on GCP. I wasn't sure if there would be an audience, so I just sort of let out my tutorial on the world and waited. Turns out there's a rather large audience! Most cloud gaming services don't have datacenters outside North America and Central Europe. As a result, there's a good deal of people looking to game on the cloud by any means. That's where my project came in, and the tutorial ended up helping myriad people run machines in locations that otherwise have no access to cloud gaming.

It was very humbling to get positive responses from people internationally, and if I have the time, I'll be sure to do more work on the subject.

### Regrets

This is an unavoidable regret, but it's a shame covid prevented the class from meeting in-person. Showing off cloud gaming to my friends in my house was a lot of fun, and it would have been awesome to show it to people in the class with similar interests. For the same reasons, I hope people taking this class next time around have the opportunity to show off their work at an in-person design expo. I always had in my head the image of playing GTA V or Red Dead Redemption 2 on my phone in the BBB!

### Next Steps

If there's any future students looking to research cloud gaming, a great next step to this project would be to get Moonlight running on AWS and Azure. There's a lot of people that just have an affinity for a certain platform, so offering the same service there would certainly have an appeal. Additionally, I'm sure there's room for improvements in the tutorial, be it through custom scripting or spawning a pre-configured machine.
